# The **tinylordy** branch

## The bootstrap.sh and deploy scheme
Since openfaux is in resume a python powered application it is very simple to build the official structure of a official packge!

The first step is create the **MANIFEST.in** and **setup.py** files. With both we can make the use of PIP. :)
With PIP running on we can make a better control of things like install/debyg third-party packagedepencies, version releases versions. Nevertheless this struct works really fine if virtual environments!

The **setup.py** has the specific comment over the lines, pls check it out!

## The server.py to openfaux_ *[...]*.py

In front of the usage of **setup.py** i think it is better option rename the main script **serve.py** to **openfaux_proxy.py** for example! :)


## Server Script Organization

(still working on it)
